# AWS Service introduction

AWS Provides a wide range of tools to make up one of the largest in the infrastructure as a service industry. It has data centers and other infrastructure globally.

## AWS Regions

_"AWS has the concept of a region, which is a physical location around the world where we group data centers. We call each group of logical data centers an “availability zone”. Each AWS Region consists of several physically separate and isolated Availability Zones within a geographic area."_

- AWS has Regions all around the world (us-east-1, us-west-2, sa-east-1, etc.)
- Most AWS services are region-scoped (Se limita el uso (configuración) de servicio por región).

_How do we choose an AWS Region?_

- **Compliance**: With data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without explicit permission.
- **Proximity**: Reduced latency to clients.
- **Available services**: Within a region new services and features aren’t available in every region.
- **Pricing**: Varies region to region and is transparent in the service pricing page.

## AWS AZs

_“An Availability Zone (AZ) is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region. Availability Zones allow customers to operate production databases and applications with greater availability, fault tolerance, and scalability than a single data center would provide.”

**Key concepts:**

- Each AZ is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity
- They’re separate from each other so that they’re isolated from disasters
- They’re connected with high bandwidth with ultra low latency

## AWS Points of Presence

(Local Zones or Edge Locations)

_”AWS Points of Presence (PoP) or Local Zones locate compute, storage, database, and other select AWS services closer to end users. Each AWS Local Zone location is an extension of an AWS Region where you can run your latency-sensitive applications with AWS services (…)”_

For example, the POPs are used for both AWS `CloudFront` to deliver content to end users at high speeds, and `Lambda@Edge` to run Lambda functions with the lowest possible latency.

**Key Concepts:**

- Amazon has 216 Points of Presence (205 Edge Locations & 11 regional Caches) in 42 countries
- Content is delivered to end users with the lowest latency possible

## Regional vs Global Services
